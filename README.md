# Hitesh Lalwani - My Portfolio Website - Built with React.js and Firebase
Live website: https://hiteshfullstackdev.web.app/

Welcome to my personal **Portfolio Website**! Designed with a sleek **neumorphism UI** and developed using **React.js**, this site showcases my skills, projects, and experience. The website is hosted on **Firebase** with a **Realtime Database** to store and manage data. Iâ€™ve integrated essential features such as **SendGrid SMTP** for email sending, **Google Recaptcha API** for site protection, and **Toastify** for notifications.

## Features

### Contact Form:
- **SendGrid SMTP + Email.js**: Seamless email sending integration to handle form submissions.
- **Google Recaptcha API**: Site-wide protection to prevent spam and ensure secure submissions.

### Hosting & Database:
- **Firebase Hosting**: Fast and reliable hosting for your portfolio site.
- **Realtime Database**: Manage and store data in real-time for an efficient user experience.

### Design:
- **Neumorphism Design**: A modern, clean, and attractive UI built using **Tailwind CSS** for responsiveness.
