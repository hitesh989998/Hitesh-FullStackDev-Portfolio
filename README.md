# Hitesh Lalwani - My Portfolio Website - Built with React.js and Firebase
Live website: https://hiteshfullstackdev.web.app/

Welcome to my personal **Portfolio Website**! Designed with a sleek **neumorphism UI** and developed using **React.js**, this site showcases my skills, projects, and experience. The website is hosted on **Firebase** with a **Realtime Database** to store and manage data. I’ve integrated essential features such as **SendGrid SMTP** for email sending, **Google Recaptcha API** for site protection, and **Toastify** for notifications.

## Features

### SMTP Setup:
- **SendGrid SMTP + Email.js**: Integrated email functionality that sends a "thank you" message to the user upon form submission, while also forwarding the submitted data to me.

### Firebase Hosting & Database:
- **Hosting**: Fast and reliable hosting, courtesy of Firebase
- **Realtime Database**: Manage and store data in real-time for an efficient user experience.

### Tailwind CSS:
- **Neumorphism Design**: A modern, clean, and attractive UI built using **Tailwind CSS**.

### Google Recaptcha v3 API:
- **Spam Prevention**: To avoid automatic form submissions from bots, Google recaptcha works silently in the background.

### Google Analytics + Hotjar Heatmaps + Screen Recordings:
- **Yes, I can see you :)**: With Hotjar and Google Analytics integrated, I can track visits, clicks, heatmaps, screen recordings, time on site, device details, etc. This data is solely for feedback—to help me refine my work and continually improve the user experience.
