# Hitesh Lalwani - My Portfolio Website - Built with React.js and Firebase
Live website: https://hiteshfullstackdev.web.app/

Welcome to my personal **Portfolio Website**! Designed with a sleek **neumorphism UI** and developed using **React.js**, this site showcases my skills, projects, and experience. The website is hosted on **Firebase** with a **Realtime Database** to store and manage data. Iâ€™ve integrated essential features such as **SendGrid SMTP** for email sending, **Google Recaptcha API** for site protection, and **Toastify** for notifications.

## Features

### SMTP Setup:
- **SendGrid SMTP + Email.js**: Email sending integration to handle form submissions.
- **Google Recaptcha API**: Site-wide protection to prevent spam and secure submissions.

### Firebase Hosting & Database:
- **Hosting**: Fast and reliable hosting, courtesy of Firebase
- **Realtime Database**: Manage and store data in real-time for an efficient user experience.

### Tailwind CSS:
- **Neumorphism Design**: A modern, clean, and attractive UI built using **Tailwind CSS** for responsiveness.
